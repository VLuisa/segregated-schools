            <h3>School segregation today primarily affects the educational opportunities given to Black and Hispanic
                students in America. However, school attendance zones are changeable. With work, we can make our school
                systems more equitable.</h3>
            <p>Most children in the American public school system go to schools based on school
                attendance zones. Many people think of this zones as factual and unchangeable lines, when in fact, these
                zones are determined by administrative boundaries that not only can be changed but were drawn in
                the past in ways that intentionally segregate students by race.</p>

        <h1></h1>
        <h2>Why did <span id="blue">Quinn </span>and <span id="orange">Vera</span> have such different days at school?
        </h2>
        <p>Although Vera and Quinn are fictional characters, their different experiences at school are based on the
            statistical differences in neighboring schools across the United States.</p>
        <p>The invisible line that separates Quinn and Vera is called a “school administrative boundary”. These
            boundaries designate which parts of a neighborhood are assigned to attend certain school. So, even though
            Quinn and Vera are in the same school district, they attend schools with different educational
            opportunities. These opportunities can either help set these students up for success or give them more
            hurdles to overcome, and this inequity can have lasting ramifications on higher education and factors like
            expected earning later in life.</p>
        <p>A study by the Urban Institute in 2021, investigates these school administrative boundaries more closely.
            They found that often these boundaries are not arbitrary, as many may assume, but in fact often divide up
            neighborhoods based on their racial makeup. </p>
        <iframe title="Average racial breakdown across school boundaries" aria-label="Split Bars"
            id="datawrapper-chart-21JJN" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/21JJN/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="326" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <p>Not all school zones segregate children, but many do.</p>
        <p>Some of the boundaries are more unequal than others and
            some are carefully drawn to designate the areas with a higher population of Black and Hispanic students to
            one school, and the area with a higher population of White students to another school.</p>
        <p>Diving deeper reveals that these boundaries can, and often do, reinforce racist <a href=""
                https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redlining />“Redlining”</a> policies that
            trace back to the 1930’s.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the Urban Institute calculated the overlapping land area of these
            redlining areas with current school neighborhood assignments. This data reveals that many school
            neighborhoods that are now assigned to communities with more Black and Hispanic students tended to overlap
            with land that was once categorized as “Declining” or “Hazardous”. Meanwhile, nearby schools who now have a
            higher share of white students, tend to overlap with land areas that were once categorized as “Best” or
            “Desirable”.</p>
        <iframe title="School inequality today mirrors historic racist redlining policies" aria-label="Range Plot"
            id="datawrapper-chart-VwNCU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VwNCU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="459" data-external="1"></iframe>


        <p>The racist policies of the 1930’s are mirrored in today’s school neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>As we saw with Quinn and Vera, a student’s school assignment can affect the quality of school they are
            assigned to. Some schools have better teachers, more staff, and more opportunities for students to be
            enrolled in gifted programs or advanced track courses.</p>
        <p>These higher quality schools are disproportionately allotted to predominantly White communities. While nearby
            schools with newer and less trained teachers, fewer staff, and fewer advanced classes are more often
            allotted to areas with a higher share of Black and Hispanic students.</p>

        <iframe title="Neighboring schools can have drastically different opportunities for students"
            aria-label="Bar chart" id="datawrapper-chart-4PkHQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4PkHQ/1/"
            scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="867"
            data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>Schools with a higher share of White students perform, on average, 142% better on standardized tests than
            their neighboring schools. Given the stark differences in quality of teachers and staff, and the increased
            disciplining of Black and Hispanic students, it's not surprising that they aren't excelling at state exams.
        </p>
        <p>Segregated schools exist across the United States. As part of their study, the Urban Institute labeled some
            boundaries between schools as "unequal". Broadly this criteria meant that the specific pair of schools had
            one side with a 25% higher share of Black or Hispanic students enrolled at the school, near the boundary, or
            within the neighborhood boundary. The full dataset from the Urban Institute had over 140,000 pairs of
            schools. Almost 2,500 of those had "unequal" boundaries, spanning across more than 600 school districts.
        </p>

        <iframe title="Percent of school boundaries that are considered &quot;unequal&quot; by state" aria-label="Map"
            id="datawrapper-chart-szwgU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/szwgU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"
            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="622" data-external="1"></iframe>
        <p>It's important to note, that just because a state has fewer "unequal" boundaries does not mean that it's
            providing better opportunities for Black and Hispanic students. In some regions this low number is due to
            low racial diversity overall.</p>
        <p>Almost 100 years after "Redlining" policies were put in place, their repercussions are still evident across
            society and affect everything from home loans to air quality. And while it's important to dismantle all of
            those systems in favor of more equitable ones, it's hard to know where to start. Although school
            administrative boundaries may seem fixed, that's not the case. Many come up for
            review on an almost yearly basic. Communities have the opportunity to de-segregate their school
            zones and provide more equitable access to students of all races.
