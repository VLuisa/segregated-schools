        <h1>Divided Schools</h1>
        <p>School administrative boundaries define the educational opportunities that students have from Kindergarten
            to
            12th grade. But these boundaries often reinforce racist redlining policies from the 1930â€™s. Shifting these
            boundaries could ensure equitable access for all students.</p>

            This is Quinn and Vera. They're both 5th graders at different elementary schools and we're going to follow
            them through a day at school.

        <p class="card" id="card-left">Quinn starts his day with a math class. He was moved into an advanced math class
            this year and
            really enjoys
            it.</p>
        <p class="card" id="card-right">Vera also has math. She finished her quiz quickly and is now doodling as the
            others in class finish
            up their
            quiz. She's good at math, but is a bit bored in this class. Her school doesn't have an advanced math program
            for her grade.</p>

        <p class="card" id="card-left">Quinn is learning history next. It's not his favorite subject but his teacher is
            funny and makes
            the material
            enjoyable anyway.</p>
        <p class="card" id="card-right">Vera was looking forward to her science lesson, but her teacher is out again.
            He's been absent for
            almost 10
            days this year. Their substitue teacher puts a movie on for the class.</p>
