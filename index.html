            <h1 class="intro__hed">School Segregation Today</h1>
            <p class="intro__dek">Most children in the American public school system go to schools based on school
                attendance zones.
            </p>
            <p>Many people think of this zones as factual and unchangeable lines, when in fact, these
                zones are determined by administrative boundaries that not only can be changed but were drawn in
                the past in ways that intentionally segregate students by race.</p>
            <p>We're going to follow a pair of (fictional) students through a day in their life at school to learn more
                about how these school boundaries affect their educational opportunities.

        <h2>Why did Vera and Quinn have such different days at school?</h2>
        <p>Although Vera and Quinn are fictional characters, their different experiences at school are based on the
            statistical differences in neighboring schools across the United States.</p>
        <p>A XXXX study by the Urban Institute, a [insert description], collected data on thousands of schools and
            compared neighboring schools by a variety of metrics.</p>
        <p>They did this by looking at schools that are neighbors and separated by some sort of school administrative
            boundary. These schools are sometimes in the same district and sometimes are not.</p>
        <p>While doing this, they collected information about the schools, the student population, and measured several
            metrics about the school including the number of staff, student educational outcomes, and student needs.</p>
        <p>They then categorized schools based on their racial makeup, and noted when a school had 25% higher share of
            black and hispanic students than its neighbor. When these schools sit next to each other we can say they
            have an "unequal" boundary between them.</p>
        <h2>On average, schools with higher shares of black and hispanic students have poorer educational opportunities
            than their neighboring schools.</h2>
        <p>As we saw with Vera and Quinn, a student’s school assignment can affect the quality of school they are
            assigned to. Some schools have better teachers, more staff, and more opportunities for students to be
            enrolled in gifted programs or advanced track courses. These higher quality schools are disproportionately
            allotted to predominantly white communities. While nearby schools with newer and less trained teachers,
            fewer staff, and fewer advanced classes are more often allotted to areas with a higher share of black and
            hispanic students.</p>

        <p>These school boundary assignments are not arbitrary — they mimic the racist neighborhood grades given to
            neighborhoods as part of the 1930’s HOLC redlining policies. At that time Home Owner’s associations graded
            different neighborhoods as either “Best”, “Excellent”, “X”, or “X”. Since that time, it has come to light
            that these neighborhoods were informed by and meant to propogate racial segregation of neighborhoods. Areas
            with more minorities were deemed as “Hazardous” and therefore these families were less likely to receive
            mortgages and other forms of financial support.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the Urban Institute, calculated the overlapping land area of
            these redlining areas with current school neighborhood assignments. This data reveals that many school
            neighborhoods that are now assigned to communities with more black and hispanic students tended to overlap
            with land that was once categorized as “Declining” or “Hazardous”. Meanwhile, nearby schools who now have a
            higher share of white students, tend to overlap with land areas that were once categorized as “Best” or
            “Desirable”.</p>

            style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="459" data-external="1"></iframe>

        <p>Almost 100 years after those policies were put in place, their repercussions are still evident. However,
            school administrative boundaries are editable — many come up for
            review on an almost yearly basic. Many communities have the opportunity to de-segregate their school
            communities and provide more equitable access to students of all races.
